**// Note
I'm using React and Material-UI to create the frontend. For the backend, I'm utilizing Express and Node.js environment, and MongoDB serves as the database.To fetch personal details such 
as name, experience, gender, address, awards, and ratings from the database, you'll need to create API endpoints in your Express backend to handle requests for this data. 
Then, in your React frontend, you can use methods like fetch to make requests to these endpoints and retrieve the necessary information. This data can be displayed in your UI once fetched from the backend.
